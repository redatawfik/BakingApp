# BakingApp
An Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world.
This is an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## Feature

* This app showcases responsive UI both for phone and tablet devices.
* Show a list of recipes
* Show a list of steps involved and a video if the step has a video
* Show a Card containing the ingredients of the recipe
* Use Exoplayer to show videos of steps involved in a recipe.
* Add a widget to show recipe ingredients on home screen.
* UI and Intents Test with Espresso.
* Supports Multi-Screen sizes.

## What I have Learned.

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
